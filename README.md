## Description

Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) is a common medical condition that can lead to serious complications if not diagnosed accurately and in time. The current diagnostic methods rely on microscopic examination or culture tests, which are slow and prone to human error. Rapid methods (e.g., strip tests) do not provide results with sufficient accuracy. Proposed solution: Automating the diagnostic process using Artificial Intelligence (AI) can improve both the accuracy and speed of diagnosis.
